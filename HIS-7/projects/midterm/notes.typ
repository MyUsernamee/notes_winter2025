== Notes

=== William Graham Sumner on Social Darwinism (Document 1, Chapter 16)

- Author: William Graham, a sociologist at Yale University in 1880s. He seems to be a white upper class, conservative, anti-enlightenment, "sociologist".
- It was created sometime in the 1880s, and was then edited by some person at Yale University Press.
- It is an essay.
- The main argument in the essay is that any form "socialism"-- giving worker fair wages, working conditions, and rights-- is counteractive to the very law's of nature. He attempts to use unrelated ideas such as Darwin's Theory of Evolution in a logical fallacy to prove his point. 
- This document is significant because it is a primary source which does a great job at capturing the uncontrolled capitalism of the time, and capitalist's general attitude on the subject.

=== Helen Hunt Jackson “A Century of Dishonor” (Document 7, Chapter 17)

- Author: Helen Hunt Jackson. She was a white writer whom became an activist for America's native people.
- This document was written in 1881. During this time, the United States had "purchased" the West and was attempting to expand westward. The government signed acts that gave land to settlers who went westward first. Due to the massive influx of people, it strained natural resources. Though there were people already inhabiting these lands, the U.S. Government promised the land to settlers and as such Native Americans ended up getting pushed out, killed, or relocated off of their own land. Many traders took advantage of the over use in resources and new land with bad business practices.
- This was a book.
- The main point of the document is that the U.S. Government needs to atone for it's atrocities by giving the stolen Native American land back to it's own people, and giving retribution to the Native American people.
- This document is significant because it is a primary source documenting the crimes the U.S. Government committed, and their unwillingness to reprimand their actions. It also shows that there were activists who recognized that this was wrong, and that the government wasn't necessarily acting in the interest of it's constituents.

=== Alan Seeger on WWI (Document 2, Chapter 21)

- Author: Alan Seeger, a poet, born in New York, educated at Harvard University, which later joined the French Foreign Legion during World War 1.
- These documents were created in 1914, and 1916 during World War 1 in France. The war had begun engulfing Europe-- where Alan Seeger was living at the time-- when Seeger, during his time in battle, wrote these two documents.
- The first is a excerpt from a letter Seeger wrote to the New York Sun in 1914; The second in a poem from his collections published in 1916.
- The main topic of these documents are about Seeger, and his comrade's experience fighting in this war; how grotesque, inhumane, barbaric and different this new style of war was.
- This document is very significant because it is a primary source of what fighting in this war was like. It documents how the style of war changed dramatically with new advancements in weaponry, and tactics. It does a great job of capturing the magnitude of this war, and the effects it had on the people fighting in it; how, for the soldiers, it went from fighting for ideologies, to fighting for your life.

=== Explanation of the Objects of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (Document 3, Chapter 22)

- Author: Marcus Garvey, a prominent Black Nationalist in the United States; founder of Black Star Line, and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNLA); and Black-owned business advocate.
- This document was created in 1921 (The roaring twenties), which was a time of major economic advancement for the United States. During this time of economic prosperity, civil right and equality under the law had yet to be cottified in the U.S; this led to many inequalities amongst immigrants, people of color, and (very largely) African Americans. Though there were inequalities, the economic momentum allowed blacks to acquire enough capital to start building their own businesses and community. There was also a general push from many, still very present, white conservative people for African Americans to "return to Africa"; this, however, was not the reasoning for Garvey's advocation.
- Instead, he was trying to unite all African people in an attempt to create more socialist government based in Africa for African American people. The main argument in this document is that all African people should unite and work together to create this new government.
- This document is a transcription of a message Garvey recorded in a New York studio stating the object of the ULNA.
- This document is quite significant because it is a primary source that captures the state of some African American's socioeconomic status, and more broadly, the socioeconomic status of the United States as a whole.
