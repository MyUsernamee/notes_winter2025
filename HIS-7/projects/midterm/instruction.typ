Section 2: Essays (60 points)
Students will write TWO essays from the list below for the midterm exam. Students can choose any two essay topics and will write two, separate essays. Each essay is worth 30 points. You must reference materials from the lecture modules to receive full credit.
Use the materials from the lecture modules and assigned readings to answer the questions. In other words, do not search the internet for answers. You can reference outside sources to answer the following questions; however, the work and arguments you produce should BE YOUR OWN! If you do use outside sources, they must be cited. You should plan to spend approximately two hours (try not to spend more than that) actually writing the exam. The completed essays should be uploaded to Canvas.

Focus on the chapters in the textbook The American Yawp which cover The Reconstruction – Chapter 15 through to the New Era - Chapter 22. Please label your essays.
