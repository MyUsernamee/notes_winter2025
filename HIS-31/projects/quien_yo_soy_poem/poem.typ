= Quien Yo Soy? Who am I?

_Who am I?_ \
Well... That depends who's asking. \
_If_ you randomly saw me, \
_I_ look like a "Hispanic dude". \
_If_ you know me, \
I'm _mixed_. \
_If_ you're a stranger, \
I'm "Leslie". \
_If_ you're my friend, \
_Sometimes_ I'm Delano. \
_If_ you're my family, \
_Sometimes_ I am DJ. \
_If_ you're my love, \
_I_ will give you the world. \
_If_ you asked, \
 _I_ love learning, programming, math, music, art, people, and so much more. \
_If_ you didn't, \
I "*wont stop*" asking you. \
_If_ you're an employer, \
I'm *Delano Leslie*. \
_If_ you're my boss \
_I'm_ already on it. \
_If_ you're my teacher, \
_Maybe I'm_ your curious student. \
_If_ you're my classmate, \
_Maybe I'm_ too chatty. \
_If_ I'm comfortable with you, \
_I_ am a girl. \
_If_ I don't know you, \
_I_ am a guy. \
_If_ you're understanding, \
I _have_ ADHD. \
_If_ you're not, \
_I_ "make excuses". \
_If_ you're a poem, \
_I_ might be the subject. \
But... _If_ you're *me*? \
*I am* not sure, *I am* still learning about, and crafting _that_, every day. \ It _definitely_ would be hard to fit, _that_, in a poem.
